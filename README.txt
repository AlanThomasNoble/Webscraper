Webscraper obtains information about the different courses offered at https://www.futurelearn.com/.

It is capable of obtaining the following: course title, mentors, a short description, 
a detailed description, duration, weekly study, cost, and category. It collects
information from all 729 of Future Learn's courses(as of 12:13pm EST 4/15/20).

The key behind this webscraping program is a Python library called BeautifulSoup. BeautifulSoup
allows me to parse HTML on a given webpage.
