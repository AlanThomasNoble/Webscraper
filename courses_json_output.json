Improve your logical and critical thinking skills Even though we\u2019re called upon to use our critical and logical thinking skills all the time, most of us are not that good at it. This free online course aims to help you develop and improve these skills. You\u2019ll learn how to: identify and avoid common thinking mistakes that lead to the formation of bad beliefs; recognise, reconstruct and evaluate arguments; use basic logical tools to analyse arguments; and apply those tools in areas including science, moral theories and law. Associate Professor Tim Dare and Dr Patrick Girard from the University of Auckland take us on an informative and engaging eight week journey through the worlds of logical and critical thinking helping us to avoid these common obstacles and fallacies and improve our logical and critical thinking skills. Throughout the course, Tim and Patrick provide videos, articles, and assignments to lead us through the thickets of logical and critical thinking. We will spend the first half of the course exploring key concepts in logical and critical thinking. In the second half of the course, we will apply those concepts in familiar areas, to help you develop practical and useful logical and critical thinking skills. We begin, in the first week, with an introduction to logical and critical thinking and common obstacles and fallacies. In week two Patrick introduces arguments.  We learn to identify premises and conclusions \u2013 components of a good argument \u2013 and by the end of this week we\u2019ll be able to construct an argument in standard form. In week three we will learn how to distinguish between deductive and non-deductive arguments and about validity, invalidity, strength and weakness. In week four we examine good and bad arguments in more detail, learning how to tell when an argument is sound or cogent, and how to evaluate an argument. Weeks five to seven examine three familiar areas \u2013 science, law, and morality \u2013 that call upon our logical and critical thinking skills in ways appropriate to the particular demands of those areas.

South Korea is at a critical juncture, particularly from global perspectives. Understand geopolitics and security From a geopolitical perspective, South Korea is located in Northeast Asia, a region from which almost all security tension in East Asia emerges. Consider, for example, the long-standing Sino-Japanese rivalry and the unresolved territorial disputes in the East China Sea. It is often said that the territorial disputes between Tokyo and Beijing have reached a \u2018boiling point.\u2019 Also, the persistent security threats posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and long-range missiles cannot be taken lightly. Most of all, the rise of China and the United States\u2019  \u201crebalance\u201d toward Asia is likely to generate a new dimension of global power politics. Explore regional cooperation and economy From a global economic perspective, however, Northeast Asia is a region of cooperation and interdependence. For example, the share of intra-regional trade between China, Japan and Korea increased from 12.3% in 1990 to 22.5% in 2010. China is largest trading partner of both South Korea and Japan. South Korea is China\u2019s third largest trading partner. In addition, two-way trade between Japan and China had reached $340 billion in 2014, and the stock of Japanese investment in China had reached $100 billion in 2014, that is $30 billion more than the next largest investor \u2014 the United States. Contemplate the future of South Korea South Korea faces both challenges and opportunities in such a dynamic region as East Asia. Furthermore, academics and policymakers alike tend to agree that the dominant issues of the twenty-first century would be decided in Asia-Pacific. As such, South Korea\u2019s national interests will be shaped by how it perceives and approaches the political and economic issues of East Asia and (by extension) Asia-Pacific. At the same time, the evolving regional order and thus the 21st century global politics would be affected by how South Korea, as one of the key actors of East Asia, behaves toward other regional states. In this respect, we aim to understand South Korea within the context of complex and important dynamics concerning global politics and the international relations of Asia-Pacific.

Many conflicts in the world today are framed in terms of religion, but there is much discussion and confusion concerning  the precise role religion plays in these conflicts. According to some,  conflict and violence are inherent to religion. Others claim that religion is only the guise under which social, economic or political conflicts are fought out. The first step to solving religiously framed conflicts is understanding the role of religion in them, and that is what this free online course is about. Our point of departure is that religion means different things in different circumstances and to different (groups of) people. Therefore, the aim of this course is to show how a religiously framed conflict can be studied in the wider cultural and political contexts of these conflicts. In the course material, we will refer to various religious, cultural and political settings. In addition, we invite you to engage in some modest research activities in your own environment and compare your own findings with those of fellow students. In the first two weeks, we will discuss how the concepts of religion, conflict and violence have been understood historically and cross-culturally, and address the question of how they are linked. This will enable you to move beyond thinking about religion as either an unavoidable cause for conflicts or merely an excuse to mask more mundane conflicts of interest. The third week focuses on the question of why religious conflicts have appeared to increase in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. During the fourth week, we will analyze case studies like conflicts over abortion policies in the United States and the rise of IS in the Middle East. In week five, we will shift our attention to the role of religion in peace building and reconciliation. The course concludes with an assignment in which you will apply your newly acquired analytical tools to write a briefing paper on the role of religion in a specific conflict situation of your own choice.

Explore the emerging field of medical humanities The course will introduce you to the emerging field of medical humanities and the concept of whole person care, via these six themes: The Heart of the Matter: A Matter of the Heart Children\u2019s Voices and Healing Mind, Art and Play Reproduction and Innovation At the Edge: Madness and Medicine Death and the Corpse Together, we\u2019ll question our propensity to separate the body from the mind in healthcare, consider what defines humanity, and share points of connection and difference between art and medicine. Learn with specialists from diverse fields Contributors to the course will include a psychologist, psychiatrist, heart surgeon, pathologist, oncologist, sociologist, poet and visual artist. They will pose critical questions about how we deal with health, healing and being human. Each has been filmed on location in Cape Town, including at the Red Cross War Memorial Children\u2019s Hospital, the Heart of Cape Town Museum, and the Pathology Learning Centre. Develop and discuss your own ideas The course will encourage you to discuss your ideas with learners all over the world, and reflect on the ways in which bodies, health, social life, culture and the imagination intersect in your local setting. Together, we\u2019ll ask: How is it that academic disciplines have become so rigid in their focus that they sometimes struggle to talk meaningfully to general audiences and other specialists? And what potential can we unlock by combining different fields of expertise and the silos of knowledge that otherwise separate them? By the end of the course, you\u2019ll understand multiple, complex perspectives on health, illness and healing, and be able to create alternative responses to important health challenges.

This free online course will bring together learners and practitioners interested in how the mind works. It aims to build bridges between traditionally antagonistic approaches to understanding the mind. What is a mind? This  question has perplexed philosophers, scientists, historians and ordinary people across time and cultures. While advances in the medical understanding of how the brain functions can shed light on neurological functions and disorders, the essential question of what the mind is speaks to a different problem. This problem cannot be answered by a purely scientific understanding of the brain, nor by a purely philosophical or psychological approach. Many disciplines have attempted to address the question, resulting in multiple and sometimes antithetical answers. New understandings of the mind On this course, Professor Mark Solms, Chair of Neuropsychology at the University of Cape Town, will adopt a multidisciplinary approach. He will bring in perspectives from a range of disciplines, to explore four specific aspects of the mind-  subjectivity, intentionality, consciousness and agency.

Explore the archaeology of the most heavily fortified frontier in the Roman Empire, its people and their lives. Hadrian\u2019s Wall stretches over 73 miles (117 km), from coast to coast in what is now Northern England. The Wall, complemented by a sophisticated system of outposts and coastal watch stations, offers a remarkable glimpse of ancient society. In addition to housing one of the largest concentrations of Roman soldiers anywhere in the Empire\u2019s provinces, Hadrian\u2019s frontier system was home to an incredibly cosmopolitan array of civilians. This six-week course offers a comprehensive introduction to Hadrian\u2019s Wall and its people and raises fascinating issues concerning colonisation, cultural transformation, immigration, integration and imperialism. We will explore life in the region before the construction of the Wall, the arrival of the Roman army and its impact on the local population. Detailed case studies will consider the different features of the Wall and its surroundings, considering the way in which the frontier system evolved throughout the Roman period. The changing face of both the Roman army and indigenous populations is richly illuminated through archaeological finds and reconstructions. To appreciate the range and character of native people, soldiers\u2019 families, slaves, merchants and migrants, we will examine their homes, dress, diet, rituals and religious beliefs. Drawing on the very latest research, we will investigate how archaeologists interpret evidence, considering: the factors that determine the survival of evidence the different methods of archaeological prospection used to detect settlement locations and better understand their organisation the planning of archaeological projects excavation techniques and the detailed study of structures and artefacts.
